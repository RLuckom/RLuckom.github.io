description: Python is my strongest language, but it's underrepresented on my github because most of what I've done has been for employers. This is a <a href="https://github.com/RLuckom/i-know-true-is-this-much">set of tests</a> in Python that illustrate interesting situations, edge cases, and behaviors that I've encountered. Forks and pull requests welcome.
