description: I wrote an SVG tree UI element using only vanilla JavaScript after suffering Dependency Fatigue on a personal project. The following is an ExtendableTree element that can be used as a Todo list. Click on the text of a node to edit it and show the dialog for deleting the node; click the plus circles beneath the nodes to add new ones.<div id="ExtendableTree"></div>
js: >
  var e = document.getElementById("ExtendableTree"); var x = new ambigui.DOGWOOD.TODOListTree({el: e, text: "TODO", contentDX: 10});
