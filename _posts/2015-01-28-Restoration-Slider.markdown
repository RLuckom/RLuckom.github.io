description: My fiancee wanted an interactive way to demonstrate the value her art restoration business delivers to customers. I made this JavaScript widget to show detailed before and after views of the artworks. Use the slider in the middle of the image to swipe between the before and after images.<div class="restoration_slider"><img src="/img/slider/slider_img_before.jpg" alt="Before" title="Before" width="300" height="187" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-807" /><img src="/img/slider/slider_img_after.jpg" alt="After" title="After" width="300" height="187" /></div>
