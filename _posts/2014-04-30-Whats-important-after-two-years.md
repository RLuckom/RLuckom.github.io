What's important after two years
----

There's a widely quoted saying attributed to Shunryo Suzuki: "In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert's there are few." I've heard this saying used as an argument both for why you should think like a beginner (more opportunity) and for the advantage experts have over beginners (spend less time exploring dead ends). I find it useful to be reminded of both of those things, so I respectfully refrain from trying to collapse that particular waveform. 

I do believe much about the mind changes with experience. I often ask myself "what is important right now?" as a way of MD5-summing my state of mind at a given instant. For instance, there was a long time during college when I was making stir fry almost every night. I remember how the process I followed and the space on the cutting board came to influence each other--when I finished cutting the vegetables they were all laid out on the cutting board in the order in which I'd cook them, no ingredient bowls or staging required. What was important? the relationship between the size of the vegetables before being cut, their size after being cut, the space on the cutting board, and the order in which they had to go into the wok. 

I fell out of practice, though. When I next tried, the first thing I did was get out enough bowls to hold all the ingredients. What was important then? Being deliberate--a place for everything and everything in its place. My beginner (or forgetful) mind moves slowly, using the generally-applicable problem-solving strategy of externalizing the structure of my solution--the bowls--so that I can validate it (do I have enough space?) and then concentrate on the details. My expert mind recognizes the properties of the materials at all the stages of cooking, and arranges them so that each stage leads naturally to the next one without me ever consciously making a decision to do it that way. I take satisfaction from the experience in both cases.

I think of this now because "what's important" to me when I write code has begun to change. I started writing tests a few months ago, and now an exploration of a new language for me means an exploration of its testing facilities. But there's a subtler change in attitude I've noticed as well; I'm more focused on incremental building, on picking the hardest problem, then breaking off the absolute smallest piece of it to work on, and repeating as many times as necessary. I'm becoming better at making things that don't break but worse at making high-level designs. I worry less about my code not doing what it should, but more about tests I know are weak and edge cases I might have forgotten. What's important has gone from "my code getting the right answer under expected conditions while I am watching" to "being confident I won't get email about this thing breaking."

As I write that description of what's important, I perceive many important things I'm not focusing on. That's ok; my current focus is a reflection of my current level of understanding. Soon I will run into problems for which my current approach is not sufficient, and I will begin to adapt my notion of what's important to larger patterns than the ones I see now.
