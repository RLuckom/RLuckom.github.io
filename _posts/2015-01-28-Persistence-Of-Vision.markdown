description: I made this persistence of vision display using the Programmable Realtime Units in a BeagleBone Black embedded Linux computer. I finished it just in time for a New Years' Eve party, and the experience taught me a lot about designing electronics and programming in assembly. There are definitely more hardware projects in my future. <div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lpmPm4T6jZI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
